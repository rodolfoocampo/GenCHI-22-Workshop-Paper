	abstract = {Telling stories helps people make sense of their experiences and
               develop a sense of control and understanding (Bochner, Ellis, \&
               Tillmann-Healy, 1997; Harvey, 1996). Research portrays
               storytelling as integral to human understanding (eg, Bruner,
               1990; Fisher, 1989), personal relationships (eg, Duck, 1994),
               individual and family identity (eg, Linde, 1993; Stone, 1988),
               and ways ofinteracting (eg, Mandelbaum, 1987, 1989; Miller,
               Mintz, Hoogstra, Fung, \& Pottset, 1992). Al though stories may
               be thought of as told individually, it is with, and {\ldots}},

	abstract = {We introduce Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on
                   publicly available code from GitHub, and study its Python
                   code-writing capabilities. A distinct production version of
                   Codex powers GitHub Copilot. On HumanEval, a new evaluation
                   set we release to measure functional correctness for
                   synthesizing programs from docstrings, our model solves
                   28.8\% of the problems, while GPT-3 solves 0\% and GPT-J
                   solves 11.4\%. Furthermore, we find that repeated sampling
                   from the model is a surprisingly effective strategy for
                   producing working solutions to difficult prompts. Using this
                   method, we solve 70.2\% of our problems with 100 samples per
                   problem. Careful investigation of our model reveals its
                   limitations, including difficulty with docstrings describing
                   long chains of operations and with binding operations to
                   variables. Finally, we discuss the potential broader impacts
                   of deploying powerful code generation technologies, covering

@book{Bowker2000-ts,
	abstract = {A revealing and surprising look at how classification systems
               can shape both worldviews and social interactions.What do a
               seventeenth-century mortality table (whose causes of death
               include ``fainted in a bath,'' ``frighted,'' and ``itch''); the
               identification of South Africans during apartheid as European,
               Asian, colored, or black; and the separation of machine- from
               hand-washables have in common? All are examples of
               classification---the scaffolding of information
               infrastructures.In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and
               Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in
               shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they
               investigate a variety of classification systems, including the
               International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing
               Interventions Classification, race classification under
               apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and
               of tuberculosis.The authors emphasize the role of invisibility
               in the process by which classification orders human interaction.
               They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how
               people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also
               explore systems of classification as part of the built
               information environment. Much as an urban historian would review
               highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city's story, the
               authors review archives of classification design to understand
               how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral
               agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of
               view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce
               advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions
               benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and
               how we think about that process are at the moral and political
               core of this work. The book is an important empirical source for
               understanding the building of information infrastructures.},

               the interaction design for artistic improvisation with a
               computer, and evaluating how CoCo Sketch affects the artistic
               creative process. We report on the initial results of early

Makris1⇑1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA2Violin Making, North Bennet St. School, 39 North Bennet St., Boston, MA 02113, USAe-mail: makris{at}mit.edu{\textdagger} Present address: Department of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley, CA 94720, USA.Abstract
The fact that acoustic radiation from a violin at air-cavity resonance is monopolar and can be determined by pure volume change is used to help explain related aspects of violin design evolution. By determining the acoustic conductance of arbitrarily shaped sound holes, it is found that air flow at the perimeter rather than the broader sound-hole area dominates acoustic conductance, and coupling between compressible air within the violin and its elastic structure lowers the Helmholtz resonance frequency from that found for a corresponding rigid instrument by roughly a semitone. As a result of the former, it is found that as sound-hole geometry of the violin{\textquoteright}s ancestors slowly evolved over centuries from simple circles to complex f-holes, the ratio of inefficient, acoustically inactive to total sound-hole area was decimated, roughly doubling air-resonance power efficiency. F-hole length then slowly increased by roughly 30\% across two centuries in the renowned workshops of Amati, Stradivari and Guarneri, favouring instruments with higher air-resonance power, through a corresponding power increase of roughly 60\%. By evolution-rate analysis, these changes are found to be consistent with mutations arising within the range of accidental replication fluctuations from craftsmanship limitations with subsequent selection favouring instruments with higher air-resonance power.

	abstract = {In this paper, the implications of applying the idea of gift exchange mechanism, inspired from Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theories, into a market-based multiagent system are explored. Our work is directed in the continuation of investigations by Knabe (2002), who addressed the formation of different organizations structures between providers in a profit-oriented market. We nevertheless scrutinize various hypotheses centered to gift exchange in which an agent sacrifices its profit for a long-term binding relationship. The idea is to aim a larger profit through alliances that are formed as an effect of gift exchange. Our suggestion is that a multiagent system (MAS) based on the social mechanism of gift exchange performs a high level of robustness and durability. The market in our case comprises of customers and providers agents. The former calls for proposals for the tasks they introduce in the market, while the latter proceed with the execution of tasks based on their abilities and other circumstances. In well defined cases, the providers are able to delegate tasks to other providers. This allows them to give presents to other providers so that the gift exchange mechanism becomes possible. The agents are either profit-oriented or the ones who prefer exchanging gifts and are in pursuit of others who also practice this mechanism. A number of interesting scenarios are examined that include preservation of a hierarchical structure in the market, situations resulting in the forming of an alliance between two providers, and split of profit-oriented and gift-giving agents.},

	annote = { It has to do with feedback, inevitably, but more precisely with circular causality as a broader cybernetic principle. (von F{\"o}rster 1993).

Paraphrasing von Forster: Interaction is when you see yourself with the eyes of the other.

For some interaction to happen between two systems, two organisms or processes, either one should be able to welcome the other's viewpoint in its own view and actions. 

Feedback not of audio but of control signals: The result is a kind of feedback loop in the low-frequency domain, or rhythm domain. 

"5 difference-sensitive circular interactions"...
"the transformations of the quartet sound are controlled by the numerical difference between the total sound in the room and the sound of the bridge of the string instruments. The difference-signal represents the room response to the string sound when the computer is quiet; it represents the response of all the sound transformers (room plus signal processing) to the string sound when the computer does make some sound. The whole interaction depends on that, which explains the rather complicated title. "

sound-specific signal processing, or adaptive DSP.

The computer also executes a variety of feature-extraction methods, using the extracted data for internal self-regulation. For example, it traces the input amplitude of the feedback events and scales the output amplitude down by an inversely proportional factor. It's a kind of ``self-gating,''.

a broader systemic principle of ``compensation.''

(so basically AdS works with homeostasis).

Background Noise Study,
The computer transforms these mouth sounds, but in so doing it is driven by properties in the sound itself, mainly amplitude, density of events and some spectral properties.

The overall infrastructure depends on so many details and fortuitous circumstances---it's literally fragile.
yet the essential concept to these works is that the real-time process should be capable of self-regulation even in unforeseen circumstances.

A more general way to address your question concerns the way by which we---composers, performers, people confronting this world in this particular point in history---establish a desirable and honest relationship to the technology we live in. I personally don't view computers as an aid to make music better, but as a technology with its own specific limitations and possibilities.

Suurely computers have opened up enormous musical possibilities, but these possibilities are relevant for me only to the extent that they cannot be reduced to a commodity that makes it easier for artists to materialize their own imaginations. That would reflect a purely instrumental notion of technology, an oversimplification of an artist's relationship to the tools of their trade. (discuss)

It would reflect, too, the computational paradigm of ``problem solving,'' and, to tell you the truth, I am skeptical that artistic endeavors are ``problemsolving'' activities. Art is made less by solving problems and more by raising (a lot of new) problems---or at least by articulating unseen problems. 

 I refrain from using visual interfaces, MIDI controllers, heat sensors, photocells, etc., and keep myself to sound as the only interface among humans, machines, and environments. This is a bit ideological, maybe.},

@article{barandiaran09,
	annote = {Abstract: "most of the available definitions of agency are either too loose or unspecific to allow for a progressive scientific program. They implicitly and unproblematically assume the features that characterize agents, thus obscuring the full potential and challenge of modeling agency."

Agency:
a) a system must define its own individuality, 
b) it must be the active source of activity in its environment (interactional asymmetry)
c) it must regulate this activity in relation to certain norms (normativity).

(ollie: haha, replace one problematic term with many problematic terms - "define", "source", "regulate").

Need definition of agency to make the term more scientific. Begin with identifying some properties of agency (is that paradoxical)...

3 key properties: individuality, asymmetry, normativity

We then discuss how spatiality and temporality are linked to and co-emerge with agency.

Definitions of agency:
Russell and Norvig (1995: 33): ``an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through effectors''
Maes (1994): ``a system that tries to fulfill a set of goals in a complex, dynamic environment''
Beer (1995): ``any embodied system [that pursues] internal or external goals by its own actions while in continuous long-term interaction with the environment in which it is situated''
Smithers (1995): ``agent systems are systems that can initiate, sustain, and maintain an ongoing and continuous interaction with their environment as an essential part of their normal functioning''
Franklin and Graesser (1996): ``an autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future''.
Kauffman (2000): a system that ``can act on its own behalf in an environment''.

So uncontroversial definition of agent: a system doing something by itself according to certain goals or norms within a specific environment. 

From this description, three different though interrelated aspects of agency follow immediately: (i) there is a system as a 
distinguishable entity that is different from its environment, (ii) this system is doing something by itself in that environment and 
(iii) it does so according to a certain goal or norm. 

Individuality requires that there are forces lumping the elements together. Jonas: artefacts' organisation is secondary to the organisation of the artefacts' designer.

"A concept of agency that cannot account for the way in which an agent defines itself as an individual requires another 
agent (the observer) to perform the system-environment distinction. If then we have to justify the identity of this observer agent 
by means of another one and so on, we enter an infinite explanatory regress. In contrast, an entity capable of distinguishing it- 
self as an individual in the absence of an observer, like Jonas proposes for the case of living organisms, does not suffer from 
this problem."

Asymmetry: An agent is a system that does something as opposed to other natural entities to which we attribute no specific actions except metaphorically.

2 ways to cause something:

1. An agent as responsible for managing and gathering the energy resources for action. (even in example of bird gliding -- it exploits the energy).
2. An agent is the centre of influence in a dynamical course of events. Possible to use stats to work out exertion of influence between two elements.

Still problematic - solution is to use weaker notion than causation.

p4: "We define interactional asymmetry as the condition describing a system as capable of engaging in some modulations of the coupling and doing so at certain times, but not necessarily always (and, for extreme cases, just capable of halting a coupling)."

Normativity:  When considering agency we presuppose that the interaction is not random or arbitrary but makes some ``sense'' for the agent itself. Agents have goals or norms according to which they are acting.

At this point we already have a set of criteria (albeit not generatively defined) to judge whether a system is a genuine agent or not.

p7: Simulations of simple living systems.. "already provide a first empirically addressable sense of indiividuality and normativity without having to evoke abstract mentalistic entities".


Generative definition of agency: an agent is an autonomous organization capable of adaptively regulating its coupling with the environment according to the norms established by its own viability conditions. (Ollie -- what about commiting suicide, what about a torture prisoner, evolution of altruism).

More detail:

S is agent for particular environment E iff:
1. S is an open autonomous system in E -- 1.1 S is network of interdependent processes, 1.2 E is the other processes that can affect or be affected by S, 1.3 S depends on certain conditions that depend on E
2. S modulates the coupling C in an adaptive manner -- 2.1 modulation means changing the coupling, 2.2 adaptive means the chance benefits S.

important that this refers to processes, meaning it can apply outside of physical structure. Also, multiple S's can be overlapping.

	annote = {For much of the last fifty years, thinking about thinking has been dominated by the computational framework.

Then came connectionism.

Almost immediately behind (around the 80s) came: situated, embodied, dynamical (SED) framework.
an agent's behavior arises from the dynamical interaction between its brain, its body and its environment.  

The philosophical roots of situated activity can be traced to phenomenology, especially the work of Heidegger (1927/1962), which was brought into AI and cognitive science primarily through the criticisms of Dreyfus (1972/1992).

One of Heidegger's key insights was the distinction he drew between objects being zuhanden (``ready-to-hand'') and vorhanden (``present-at-hand''). In our normal daily experience, we usually encounter things as resources for 
immediate action in the service of achieving our goals. For example, to someone in the act of hammering a nail, the hammer in some sense ceases to exist.

Another important precursor to situated activity was Gibson's Ecological Psychology (Gibson, 1979). Based on his studies of vision in World War II pilots, Gibson emphasized the structure inherent in an organism's environment and the importance of the organism/environment relation to a theory of perception.  For example, the optic flow field of a visual animal moving through its environment carries a great deal of information about the direction and speed of motion, distances to objects, surfaces, textures, etc. Gibson's views eventually encompassed a wide-ranging rejection of cognitivism.  However, for our purposes here, Gibson's most important contribution is his notion of affordances, the possibilities for action that an environment presents to an agent.  

A third important influence on situated activity came from work in the social sciences.



Another intellectual thread comprising the SED approach is dynamics, within which we 
must distinguish at least three ideas. 
D1) Dynamical systems theory (DST). A mathematical theory that can be applied to any system characterized by a state that changes over time in some systematic way. 
D2) The dynamical framework. A collection of concepts, intuitions, and metaphors involved in taking a dynamical perspective on some system of interest. 
D3) The dynamical hypothesis. A specific hypothesis, put forward by Tim van Gelder (1998), for how DST and the dynamical framework could be combined into a rigorous counterproposal to the traditional computational hypothesis in AI and cognitive science. 

Even though behavior is a property of the entire coupled system, it is still meaningful to ask about the relative contributions of brain, body and environment to some particular feature of a behavioral trajectory.  In order to do so, we must open the coupled brain-body-environment system by cutting one or more of the coupling pathways in order to isolate the component we wish to study.  This component then becomes a nonautonomous dynamical system

3 orders of social mediation: produces varied social relations, inflects existing ones, and bound up in the broader institutional forces of its production and reproduction.

p8: " reveal music as a medium that destabilizes some of our most cherished dualisms concerning the separation not only of subject from object, but present from past, individual from collectivity, the authentic from the artificial, and production from reception."

Music forms into assemblages - historical shapes.

Lydia Goehr - The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works
"Charting the rise from around the year 1800 of the romantic, idealist philosophy of the musical work, Goehr embeds that rise in a constellation of changes, many of them subsumable under the Weberian thesis of the progressive rationalization and autonomization of music and art. Among these changes were the rise of the romantic principle that musical invention depended on the self-expression of the individual composer-genius, who must refuse to follow established rules or submit to external controls; and the arrival of a `work-based practice' centred on the belief that musical works were perfectly formed, finished and `untouchable', and transcended any particular performance. "

p11: "Theories of mediation have rightly been central to the development of both critical musicology and the cultural study of music."

13: "Mediation in this sense refers to what DeNora calls the `co-productive' or two-way interrelations between music and social life." 
Stress that this can't be worked out in advance - depends on affordances.

14: "Antoine Hennion, another formative writer on mediation, in his historical analysis of the growth of the `love of Bach' argues similarly that it is not enough to study Bach reception and the development of a taste for Bach -- that is, the production of musical subjects -- without grasping also the formation of their object -- that is, both the Bach oeuvre and the recognition of Bach's genius."

"Laudable in this approach is the aim of tracing the specific practices and connotations that clothe music and endow it with meaning, and of taking dissemination, attachment and the roles of amateur and music-lover in history as seriously as those of composer or professional musician."

"stabilities of meaning can be repeatedly observed in music history, as powerful discourses or metaphors come to structure musical experience; moreover they are performative, conditioning future musical expressions and compositional practices."

p15: "But although such stabilities may be made up of many small acts and individual experiences, they cannot be reduced to them. They depend on the construction of institutional and economic foundations, authority and legitimacy, and charismatic figures"

"If the example of IRCAM requires us to probe the gap between the discourse of invention and its actuality, it also illustrates a basic property of creativity: that it is social."

p16: "all cultural production constructs and engages relations not only between persons, but also between persons and things, and it does so across both space and time."

Gell " locates his account in a central anthropological tradition: Marcel Mauss's analysis of gift exchange, in which prestations or gifts are treated as extensions of persons."

"Through the art object, ... social relations are distributed and dispersed both temporally and spatially.  But in the process the social relations are also relayed and transformed, as are the objects themselves."

p20: "Marquesan art objects are fragments of the `larger unities' to which they belong by stylistic linkages. `Artworks are . . . portions of a distributed object corresponding to all of the artworks in the Marquesan system, distributed in time and space.'57 This leads Gell to propose `the notion of a ``corpus'' of artworks as a kind of spatio-temporally dispersed ``population'' ' where such a corpus is a product of what he calls the `extended mind' -- that is, externalized and collectivized cognitive processes."
(note Art and Agency written in 1998, same year as Clark and Chalmers paper, The Extended Mind).

p21: "Gell shows how such a Husserlian perspective illuminates the relations between works in any artist's {\oe}uvre: how later works are anticipated in earlier ones, and how retentions or traces of earlier works are found in later ones."

p22: "Gell's illumination of the four kinds of dispersal of creative agency: the way that creative agency can be distributed across time, across space, the way it forges relations between persons, and between subjects and objects."

p24:  "the tradition culminating in IRCAM attempted a kind of blocking of aesthetic alternatives through its hegemony; while the appearance of innovation was effected by various displacements -- through association with technological change and progressive scientific discourses.64 It is important, then, to build on Gell's account with reference to those aesthetic systems which, conscious of the value attached to innovation, ape its appearance; and by considering those systems that, in reality, occlude the anticipation of the new through anti-invention."

Distinguish two aspects of social distribution of creative agency: relations between listeners and audiences (establishing a 'we'), and distribution between different authors, as well as subjects and objects, human and non-human agents.

p25: "With centrifugal force, and more easily than in its commodity forms, music is scattered, flung via the internet in near-real time from any point of creation and departure to any number of points of destination. Moreover, digitized music's immateriality and hyper-mobility as code cause both the economic and legal property regimes associated with the pre-digital era to become outdated and impotent. This is all well established."

@article{brown07,
	abstract = {Two of the most salient features of music are the blending of pitch and the matching of time. I propose here a possible evolutionary precursor of human music based on a process I call ``contagious heterophony''. Heterophony is a form of pitch blending in which individuals generate similar musical lines but in which these lines are poorly synchronized. A wonderful example can be found in the howling of wolves. Each wolf makes a similar call but the resultant chorus is poorly blended in time. The other major feature of the current hypothesis is contagion. Once one animal starts calling, other members of the group join in through a spreading process. While this type of heterophonic calling is well-represented in nature, synchronized polyphony is not. In this article, I discuss evolutionary scenarios by which the human capacity to integrate musical parts in pitch-space and in time may have emerged in music. In doing so, I make mention of neuroimaging findings that shed light on the neural mechanisms of vocal imitation and metric entrainment in humans, two key processes underlying musical integration. 
},
	annote = {``contagious heterophony''. I define this term as follows: a group vocalization in which each individual produces a variation on a similar kind of call but in which the members of the group call asynchronously; group-wide vocalizing emerges through a 
sequential process of spreading or contagion. 

As Harrington (1989) has shown, howls become shorter, higher, and more frequency-modulated as the chorus progresses. 
There is a great increase in spectral variation as chorus proceeds, making the wolf chorus into a kind of jam session. 

The concept of contagious heterophony can be seen as providing important insights into the nature of music. First, a system based on contagious heterophony places music firmly within the domain of group vocalization from its origin. This jibes well with more than a century's worth of ethnomusicological research showing that music is, in its most basic sense, a means of group communication  (Merriam, 1966, Dissanayake, 2000), one that is useful in solidifying social groups (Brown, 2000; Hagen & Bryant, 2003).

small individual repertoires need not impose a constraint on creating group-level complexity. My suspicion is that this point applies equally well to many forms of human music-making. 

"...an important clue as to how this kind of system might operate both psychologically and neurally. Contagion is a kind of resonance behaviour..."

To sum up, I argue that a vocal system based on contagious heterophony provides a reasonable precursor for the systems that will become both song and speech in modern humans. 

goes to homophony or entrainment in music, eventually, and turn-taking in langauge.},

	annote = {Abstract: "Emergence is the appearance of novel entities that in one sense or another could not have been predicted from what came before."

emergence: of formal structures, of material structures, of functions and organizations, of new perspectives.

Epistemic emergence involves the creation of new points of view, such as new senses in biology.
In art, epistemic emergence can involve formation of new "ways of seeing"

2 modes of creating novelty: combinatoric and creative (new primitives)

combinatoric systems are closed, creative systems are open due to "partial or ill-defined nature of the space of possible primitives".

"emergence is broader than simply the creation of new structures or behaviors. It also includes the formation of fundamentally new organizations of matter -- life"
(me -- what's the difference between 'new' and 'fundamentally new'?)

"Effectively the epistemic umwelt or "life-world" of the species (Uexk{\"u}ll, 1926) becomes enlarged in its dimensionality whenever a new sense organ is formed or elaborated in a new way. Color vision amplifies vision; echolocation amplifies audition; chemical analysis amplifies smell and taste. "

"All technology involves the amplification or augmentation of biological functions." (me -- too simlistic).

"On sociocultural scales, new perspectives, systems of interpretation, or "paradigms" can appear. In art, new techniques of producing artworks and new "ways of seeing" can appear. For example, over the history of Western painting, there has been a succession of styles and interpretations, each constructed from different sets of visual elements and techniques. At some junctures, new perspectives about art itself emerged, radically altering the interpretation of what art itself means (Hughes, 1991)."

Consciousness
"My working hypothesis is that a particular organization of neuronal activity is required for that activity to change awareness"

"As we mentioned earlier, it is conceivable that matter, energy, and time may be emergent aspects of the universe. There is also the fundamental question of whether consciousness itself is an emergent aspect of the universe"

"In the realm of art and technology, conceptions of emergence have some utility as \emp{heuristics for creativity}."

Combinatoric v Creative Emergence

"To say that an entity is "primitive" relative to other objects or functions means it cannot be constructed from combinations of 
the others, i.e. its properties cannot be logically deduced from those of other entities. Thus, in this way of thinking, simple combinations of ``lower-level objects'' do not create ``higher-level primitives'' because the higher-level systems can be decomposed into yet lower-level objects (atoms). "
(me - so for any entity, except perhaps some particles or god or something, there is another entity that makes this entity not-primitive. The distinction is a false one!).

"In our opinion, the most salient examples of the creation of new primitives involve the biological evolution of new sensory capabilities."

And of course the Pask example: "Albeit, in a very rudimentary way, the artificial device automated the creation of new sensory primitives, thereby providing an existence proof that creative emergence is possible in adaptive devices."

"To the degree that a system has control over its own structure and functions, it attains a degree of freedom vis-{\`a}-vis both its environment and its own history."

"We argue that combinatoric systems are closed, while systems that create their own primitives are open-ended with respect to their current set of primitives. This is because the process for generating new primitives is undefined -- if it were defined, it would be part of the combinatorial rules, and we would simply see the system as a larger combinatorial system."

"Like the set of all possible distinguishable objects, the set of possible measurements (observables) and actions that can be carried out respectively by sensors and effectors is ill-defined and open."

"There are several pieces in this exhibition that are potentially creative-emergent in this sense -- they have enough richness and autonomy in their dynamics that it is difficult to draw a clear boundary of their possibility spaces"

"The second mode of creative emergence is that an art piece can provoke new ideas, meanings, and perspectives in its audience."

"In practice, in the context of art and aesthetics, it can be difficult to assess whether new primitives have been created either in an artefact or in the audience."

"For better or worse, I think of art as aesthetic engineering, the goal being to design objects and performances that move people in some significant way. "},

	annote = {Musical improvisation is driven mainly by the unconscious mind.

An artificial agent that mediates between an improvisor and her unconscious mind,  to probe and unblock improvisatory action in live music performance or practice. 

Our criteria for this agent are: It must take input from live music improvisation as its main body of data and primary control device, and it must enable the player to navigate a map of unconscious musical gestures (musical phrases and their timbral, rhythmic interrelationships) by providing an evolving `mirror` to her playing. 

Frank tries to activate the dialogic processes of the improvisor's mind, in particular the quicksilver heuristics involved in finding improvisational pathways within musical material through instrumental practice. Our aim is to enable a state of flow in the player, in which her dialogic imagination can be receptive to the kind of motivic/harmonic play mature Jazz musicians experience. 


We give our system a division of tasks: the male population in our genetic algorithm produces many answers to the musical space question (an incoming query by way of real-time audio, such as a piano chord). The female population criticises those answers, isolates winners, and breeds with them. 

Cluster pre-loaded and incoming audio. Each cluster becomes a lexeme. Then consider path through lexemes.


We have 2 populations: males and females. Every gen- 
eration each female will choose a male and breed. Every 
male can breed more than once but can also not breed at all 
if no female choses him. The fitness function implements 
how a female will chose her male. 
Let us clarify, at this point, how the female genotype 
is constructed, as it represents the essential input from the 
lexemes database into the general population: after feature 
extraction is put into a data array, the use of the k-means 
algorithm gives us a clustered centers; these become the 
lexemes, and are stored in their own array. When this ar- 
ray is full, a new genotype is created, and this becomes 
the female genotype and is inserted into the population as 
a new individual. 
When a male and a female breed they create a new 
string randomly taking part of the genotype from the mother
and part from the father (the crossover), and the new indi- 
vidual can be both male or female (randomly). Mutations 
then occur, and this produces new musical material in the 
form of phenotypes, or winning individuals. The GA pro- 
cess runs many times per second, since we want to our 
solutions to evolve over time, and to produce fluent musi- 
cal production. },

@mastersthesis{conklin90,
	abstract = {This thesis develops and evaluates predictive theories
		of music. Good theories should model a particular class of music and
		predict new pieces in the class with high probability. Attention is
		restricted to melody alone -- harmony and polyphony are not
		considered. Theories are constructed using an empirical learning
		approach, and to construct and evaluate them, one hundred Bach
		chorale melodies are analyzed.  Theories are evaluated by a data
		compression measure, which is a strong indicator of their predictive
		power. The entropy of the chorales is estimated by averaging the
		amount of compression given to a test set using a theory learned
		from a training set. The central hypothesis is that the chorales are
		quite redundant in the information theoretic sense. A novel approach
		to the induction of sequence generating rules, called multiple
		viewpoints, is created. This method is based on the variable--order
		Markov model, with extensions to incorporate timescales and parallel
		streams of description. A multiple viewpoint system comprises two
		parts: a long--term theory which adapts to a class of sequences, and
		a short--term theory which adapts to a particular instance of the
		class. Predictions from both are combined into an overall
		prediction. The performance of several different multiple viewpoint
		systems is assessed on the chorale data. The redundancy of the
		chorales is thereby estimated to be 55\%. This thesis concludes that
		the estimate must be compared with human performance at the same
		predictive task. The theory should also be evaluated in terms of the
		quality of the new chorales it generates, and by its ability to
		discriminate chorales from non--chorales.},

@article{cox01,
	abstract = {Research into the bodily basis of musical meaning
             has focused on conceptual metaphor and image 
             schemata, but the processes whereby embodied
             experience becomes relevant to music 
             conceptualization remains largely unexplained. This
             paper offers an account of music conceptualization
             that helps explain how embodied experience motivates
             and constrains the formation of basic musical
             meaning. The core of the "mimetic hypothesis" holds
             that 1) we understand sounds in comparison to sounds
             we have made ourselves, and that 2) this process of
             comparison involves tacit imitation, or mimetic
             participation, which in turn draws on the prior
             embodied experience of sound production. Evidence
             for the hypothesis comes from developmental and
             neuropsychological studies, and from speech imagery,
             motor imagery, and musical imagery studies. The
             embodied experience activated during mimetic 
             participation motivates and constrains the
             cross-domain mappings on which so many musical
             concepts depend. For example, the metaphoric concept
             of musical verticality cannot be accounted for 
             without acknowledging the role of mimetic
             participation. If this participation is as
             fundamental to musical experience as the hypothesis
             suggests, not only will it allow us to account for
             music's most fundamental concepts, but it will also
             help account for the affective features of musical
             experience and meaning. Furthermore, the proposed
             view of mimetic participation helps establish a
             physical grounding for theories of musical gesture,
             semiotics, music and gender, music and drama, aural
             skills pedagogy, music and society, music and dance,
             and music therapy.},

music is a communicative medium with features that are optimally adapted for the management of situations of social uncertainty.
(strange for Cross to be so neo-Darwinian as to say 'optimally adapted')

music achieves this end by presenting the characteristics of an honest signal while under-specifying goals in ways that permit individuals to interact even while holding to personal interpretations of goals and meanings that may actually be in conflict.  

a theory of meaning in music is presented...[based on] principles that underlie animal communication



The use of language, with its potential for specificity and singularity of meaning, may also pose problems.

In situations of social uncertainty language may become inefficacious or even dysfunctional.

it is in just these types of situation where music appears to be most likely to manifest itself.

(me - so interesting to think of music as 'interaction' in a cultural environment, rather than 'communcation')

3 dimensions of musical communication:

motivational-structural: conditioned by biological heritage
socio-intentional: 
culturally-enactive: particularities of the cultural contexts in which we develop

"We are arguing that what appears to distinguish [language and music] most clearly is their efficacy in different social contexts (see also Cross, 2006); both language and music are instrumental in achieving social goals, but language organises social action while 
music organises sociality. "

             account of the role of music in human evolution. At the
             outset I must admit that it is in part motivated by a
             personal desire to defend the value of music as a human
             activity - as a musician, the notion of music as
             "parasitic cheesecake" is somewhat unpalatable. But it is
             also motivated by a desire to try to make sense of the
             varieties of music, of the multiplicities of roles that
             music plays in human lives and of the myriad and
             divergent meanings that have been attributed to music. In
             this attempt I shall be putting forward a view of music
             as rooted in human biology and its evolution, but one
             that is not intended to be reductionist or simply
             sociobiological. I shall not be arguing that there is a
             "gene for music", but rather that our musicality is
             grounded in human biology as expressed in the evolution
             and development of our cognitive capacities and of our
             social and environmental interactions. Music is a product
             of, and a process in, our individual development, the
             cultures that enfold our "lifelines"[4] and the evolution

8. 'Creativity, at least as I deal with it in this book, is a process by which a symbolic domain in the culture is changed.'

this is not automatic and takes effort - memes must be learnt before they can be changed.

firstly, a surplus of attention is required.

9. speicialization is inherent and necessary. Since there is too much to learn (pay attention to) specialist knowledge is more valuable than generalist knowledge, and specialists will take control of respective domains.

Creative people appear selfish and ruthless but are not: this is a product of their need to specialise, and their intense interest in their area.

why study creativity: it seems elitist and luxirious: but (p11) 'creativity... provides one of the most exciting models for living'

we have 2 contradictory drives: conservatism, conservation of energy, versus risk, curiosity. 

23. "Where is creativity? The answer is obvious: Creativity is some sort of mental activity, an insight that occurs inside the heads of some special people. But this short assumption is misleading. If by creativity we mean an idea or action that is new and valuable, then we cannot simply accept a person's own account as the criterion for its existence. There is now way to know whether a thought is new except with reference to some standards, and there is no way to tell whether it is valuable until it passes social evaluation. Therefore, creativity does not happen inside people's heads, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a sociocultural context. It is a systemic rather than an individual phenomenon."

24. "Who is right: the individual who believes in his or her own creativity, or the social milieu that denies it? It we takes sides with the individual, then creativity becomes a subjective phenomenon. All it takes to be creative, then, is an inner assurance that what I think or do is new and valuable. There is nothing wrong with defining creativity in this way, as long as we realize that this is not at all what the term originally was supposed to mean--namely, to bring into existence something genuinely new that is valued enough to be added to the culture. On the other hand, if we decided that social confirmation is necessary for something to be called creative, the definition must encompass more than the individual."

cf brilliant and creative. Brilliant people are not creative unless they contribute something significant. 

3 uses of the term creativity; 
1) someone unusually bright - these are 'brilliant'
2) experience the world in novel and original ways. these are 'personally creative'
3) have changed our culture in some important respect - these are 'creative'

also cf talent and genius. You can be creative without being particularly talented. Genius = brilliance + creativity.

28: "Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one".

"[A creative person] is someone whose thoughts or actions change a domain, or establish a new domain".

behaviour based on examples in which emergent 
qualities become apparent through a user's perception of 
a graphical display.

This seemingly arbitrary one-to-one mapping of spatial to 
audio characteristics can be regarded as a sonification of 
primarily graphic systems rather than the design of 
emergence in the sound domain. 

We propose that a re-thinking of the mapping 
process is essential in order to address the potential of 
emergence as a sonic construct. 

Our research addresses systems that seek to 
exhibit emergence in the sonic domain by referring to 
common underlying qualities with the original nature- 
derived model.

Expanding on the notion of 
``metaphorical systematicity'', Lakoff and Johnson note 
that ``to comprehend one aspect of a concept in terms of 
another{\ldots} will necessarily hide other aspects of the 
concept'' [4]. In other words, a metaphorical relationship 
is dependent on the identification of concepts that will 
come into focus when considering two different systems. 
The model of the emergent system needs to act as a 
metaphor of the original system.

	abstract = {Does the music that we know have a language-like
             semantics? I argue that mere agreement among auditors
             about their cognitive representations and descriptions of
             music doesn't give grounds for attributing meaning to
             music. I also argue that music does not have a
             language-like semantics not because it fails to be
             robustly referential, but because musical structures are
             not genuine grammars. The reason is that while music
             typically has very elaborate and regular structures -
             much like language - these structures do not apparently
             originate from nor are they in the service of the need to
             encode meanings - exactly unlike language. Nonetheless,
             the difference between languages and music is more a
             matter of degree than of kind. In other words, we can
             imagine transforming what we now call music into a
             language; if, by some strange necessity, music were
             pressed into service on a day-to day basis for the
             purposes of comprehension and communication, then it
             could without much trouble become a language. But we
             would very likely no longer regard the strangely
             melodious utterances of such a language to be real music
             once it came to serve, in a quite transparent way, its
             pragmatic communicative and cognitive functions. I
             explain these views as a consequence of an old-fashioned
             aesthetic theory of music cognition as newly formulated
             by Raffman (1993). },

	abstract = {The evolution of altruistic behaviour is studied in a simple action-response game with a tuneable degree of con#ict of interest. It is shown that for the continuous, mixed-medium approach no stable polymorphism favours altruism. Ecological dynamics are explored with the addition of a spatial dimension and a local energy variable. A continuous spatial model with "nite local range does not introduce any substantial di!erence in the results with respect to the level of altruism. However, the model illustrates how ecological coupling may lead to the formation of stable spatial patterns in the form of discrete and isolated clusters of players as a consequence of inverse density dependence. A discrete, individual-based model is built in which local interactions are also modelled as occurring within a "nite neighbourhood of each individual and spatial positions are not restricted as in lattice models. This model shows substantially di!erent results. A high level of altruism is observed for low (but positive) degrees of con#ict and this level decreases linearly for higher degrees of con#ict. The evolution of altruism is explained by studying the broken symmetries introduced by the spatial clusters themselves, mainly between their central and peripheral regions which, in combination with the discrete and the stochastic nature of the model, result in the stabilization of strategies in which players behave altruistically towards the same type. As a consequence of the activity of the players, energy resources at the centre of an altruistic cluster are very depleted; so much so that, for low con#ict, "tter non-altruistic mutants may initially invade only to become locally extinct due to their less e$cient use of energy as their numbers increase. In peripheral regions invader may subsist; however, for geometrical reasons long-lasting genealogies tend to originate only at the centre of a cluster. },

p186. One good illustration of the integrative capability of mimesis is found in the human capacity for tracking, and creating, rhythm. Rhythm is an integrative mimetic skill, related to both vocal and visuomotor mimesis. Rhythm is a uniquely human attribute; no other creature spontaneously tracks and imitates rhythms in the way humans do, without training. Rhythmic ability is supramodal... Rhythm is therefore evidence of a central mimetic controller that can track various movement modalities \emph{simultaneously} and in parallel. ... Rhythm, however, is different from other mimetic devices; it does not directly reproduce, represent, or signify any aspect of the natural world. It has to be regarded as a mimetic game, usually a reciprocal game, which is played for its own sake. .. Without a linguistic environment, it is likely that the uses of rhythm and vocalisation would be largely supplementary to the major governing modes of mimetic representation, which are visually dominated. 

p198. Mimesis can be cleanly dissociated from the symbolic and semiotic devices upon which modern culture depends. It serves different functions and is still far more efficient than language in diffusing certain kinds of knowledge; for instance, it is still supreme in the realm of modelling social roles, communication emotions and transmitting rudimentary skills. 

p199. The logic of evolutionary biology gives us another compelling reason to place mimesis ahead of language in the evolutionary succession. Any change or variation needs and appropriate setting for its adaptive advantage to become evident, or the individuals exhibiting that variation will not be successful. It its first form a variation may not serve the same function it ultimately serves; features first achieved thermoregulation, not flight. Language is a very exotic adaptation indeed; there is no precedent for it in other species. And language is a social skill, dependent on the availability of a linguistic milieu for its development in the individual. ... Such a milieu could not have existed when human speech began to evolve and probably would not have developed for many generations after the first individuals with a capacity for speech came into existence. Speech provided humans with a rapid, efficient means of constructing and transmitting verbal symbols; but what good would such an ability have done if there was not even the most rudimentary form of representation already in place? There had to be some sort of semantic foundation for a speech adaptation to have proven useful, and mimetic culture would have provided it.

p233. The need for an extalingnuistic referential system reminds us of a more fundamental truth: the words and symbols of language must ultimately have originated outside of language. Symbols, like the countless new words introduced over the millennia of humankind's existence, were initially invented for \emph{nonlinguistic} purposes. This had to be so, especially in their initial appearance in the collective lexicon. At one time, none of the words we possess existed, and literally none of the concepts expressible in English today existed in the lexicon. If Recorde's relatively minor invention of the equal sign within a highly developed symbolic repertoire of his time was a creative leap, then imagine the leap it required to have invented, for the first time in the history of evolving mind, a word to express the concept `equal'. Or a symbol for any number of common objects, actions, feeling, and relations, as each received its first representation.
Linguistic invention is public and market-driven. The rapid modern growth of the number of available verbal symbols shows that symbols--new words, expressions, and notations--continue to emerge in large numbers and enter the public domain in an unending stream. Some of these became part of the accepted linguistic convention, whether of society in general or of a special group or class, and some are abandoned. Language is dynamic and collectively determined; it must have been this way from the start. ... Expressions survive only if they capture, in a very competitive market, a notion the public wants expressed. ... 

p256. Bruner (1986) distinguishes two major modes of thought, the narrative and the paradigmatic. Narrative imagination constructs stories and historical accounts of events. Paradigmatic imagination seeks logical truth. Narrative skill develops early and naturally in children, whereas the logical-scientific skills that support paradigmatic thought emerge only after systematic education. The difference between these modes of thought run very deep, even to the definition of truth employed by each. In modern culture, the narrative mode still predominates in the arts, while the paradigmatic predominates in the sciences. There is little doubt that narrative thought developed earlier in human history than scientific and logical thought...  

p257. Narrative skill is the basic driving force behind language use, particularly speech: the ability to describe and define events and objects lies at the heart of language acquisition. Group narrative skills lead to a collective version of reality; the narrative is almost always public. ... [Narrative skill is] \emph{the natural product of language itself}. ... 

p258. The supreme product of the narrative mode, in smaller preliterate societies, is the myth. ... The myths stands at the top of the cognitive pyramid in such a society; it not only regulates behaviour and enshrines knowledge, but it also constrains the perception of reality and channels the thought skills of its adherents. And those who preserve and regulate myth--priests and shamans--hold positions of great power in the collective cognitive hierarchy. ... Myth is the inevitable outcome of narrative skill and the supreme organizing force in Upper Paleolithic society. ... Narrative and myth did not displace mimetic cognition but rather complemented it perfectly. 

p259. It is conceivable that all known human languages... descended from a common ancestor in less than a hundred thousand years. The linguistic heritage of \emph{Homo sapiens sapiens} is a heritage of incredibly rapid, unceasing change and innovation. ... This serves to justify ... the emphasis I have placed on symbolic invention as the central underlying linguistic skill.

Computers are symbol processing machines, but we experience them as dynamical systems.

Between views of computer as 'tool' or 'window' lies a perspective looking 'at machine as a complex adaptive system' rather than at its output.

p291. Burnham: dynamical systems as life in the artist's hands, and the dominant medium of further aesthetic ventures. ``A 'systems aesthetic' stemming from the original ideas of Bertalanffy and closely aligned with the writings of Burnham forms the core of current Artificial Life Art and Generaive Electronic Art.'' See Whitelaw, metacreation for ref.

p292. ``The modern digital computer is unique. To squander it on confronting reality in the context of art is mediocre.''

The point being (I think) that the relationship between real and virtual is dull and uninformative. (possibly similar to when Jon refers to fetishism).

Preference for works that do not suggest a 'something in there' but rather a something 'on there'.

Turn to Ecosystems because the dynamical systems we want computers to run must exhibit: coherence and unity; multi-scaled temporal complexity; autonomous production of novelty; responsiveness to perturbation.

153. Ecology, systems theory and cybernetics were fad in social science in 60s and 70s (as poststructuralism, political economy and cultural studies was in 80s and 90s). 

``From these resources cultural ecology developed one of its central and most controversial claims: that human activities, much like the activities of other organisms, played {\it functional roles} within ecological systems, roles which contributed to the integrity and continuity of these systems.''

Notions of adaptation to and regulation of environments.

Fraught with difficulties, but likewise unfairly dismissed.

154: ``In important respects, cultural ecology was a reaction to developments in anthropology (and elsewhere in the social sciences) which had resulted in `culture' (or `society') being understood to develop according to its own internal dynamics, entirely {\it autonomous} from its physical environments.''

Harris (1994) complained that we assumed that culture begot culture and lost track of the material conditions.

This view was in turn a reaction to environmental determinism, from the middle of the century, and possibilism (also mentioned in moran90): - developed by Paul Vidal de la Blanche. ``The belief that nature set certain parameters within which humans exercised choice or will.''

Geographers and anthropologists had rightly identified both as harbouring dubious, even racist, conclusions. (wow!)

Geertz (63) criticised this level of abstraction as reducing eskimos to inhabitants of polar regions and aborigines to inhabitants of deserts.

Actor-network theory emerged to attack this division: Latour, redefining the relationship between people and things.

``Latour (1993), for instance has argued that our failure to locate people and things on the same ontological and analytical plane is the reason we `shuttle' between two opposed positions - that people are all-powerful and can transform their culture in whatever way they pleased (culture begets culture), or that people are impotent and can do nothing, since culture is determined by nature (environmental determinism).''

p55. ``Significantly neither Steward nor Geertz sought to collapse {\it all} cultural practices and {\it all} ecological processes into a single system. Geertz, in particular, argued that some practices were completely unrealted to environmental conditions, and rejected Steward's designation of `core' and `contingent'.''

``These limited qualifications would appear to go some way to rescuing cultural ecology from accusations that it merely packaged and updated environmental determinism. But others were far less cautious and sought to extend the emerging discipline further in the direction of finding `adaptation' as the key to culture.'' (e.g., Vayda and Rappaport 1968).

Rappaport: looking at homeostatic maintenance of environment through ritual.

Growing ecosystemic approach: interacting system, circular relationship and systems of negative and positive feedback. Mutual influence and change.

Later came under criticism, but (Geertz) distinction between man and nature orientation of analysis disappears. ``Geertz imagined that it was possible to understand cultures and their environments as {\it single} entities, anticipating in a somewhat uncanny manner similar calls made across the social and ecological sciences several decades later.''

Geertz argued that possibilism and anthropogeography started by distinguishing between culture and nature and then asking how one might influence the other. Criticises as too crude.

157. ``Even Geertz, known later for his `thick description' of cultural practices, drew inspiration from Odum in order to argue that the `maintenance of system equilibrium of homeostasis is the central organising force' of specific cultures and cultural practices.''

``As complex as were cultural ecology's charts of energy flows, and as finely grained as were its descriptions of the ecological role of cultural practices, it was never quite able to adequately answer the `why' question of cultural practices. Neither the {\it genesis} of cultural practices nor their {\it transformation} could be explained, except through vague appeals to `adaptation'.''

Also the merging of culture and nature was a 'sleight of hand' - collapsing culture into nature.

During the 80s, challenges to cultural ecology's central concepts - adaptation, trophic systems, feedback loops, homeostasis - intensified. Problems of functionalism and historicism: leading to teleological conclusions. ``All cultural practices were seen to lead to the same inevitable and (ecosystem integrity).'' But some, Vayda and Rappaport, argued that they were not explaining why, but how -- what effect practices had - i.e., non-teleological function.

Other cultural ecologists pointed out that some cultural practices resulted in catastrophic change.

For many critics, the language of ecology was partly to blame: understanding culture to be like an organism, and consequently ignoring relations of power, except in the case where one cultural group displaced another.

ME: Homeostasis is a pretty way of saying deadlock.

Second moment of ecology: political ecology.
159. ``How did political ecology reconfigure ho geographers approached the problem of the {\it relation} between culture and nature? In brief: by tuning to the social.''

	annote = {Abstract: "The power of the unaided, individual mind is highly overrated: The Renaissance scholar no longer exists."
"Creative activity grows out of the relationship between individuals and their work, and from the interactions between an individual and other human beings. "

Distances and diversity are important sources for social creativity.

"Despite the rhetoric of collaboration, however, we continue to advocate a culture --- in our universities, schools, offices, and communities --- in which people need to distinguish themselves as individuals."

We need to collaborate (urgency?)

"Creativity does not happen inside people's heads, but in the interaction between a person's thoughts and a socio-cultural context"


"Social creativity explores computer media and technologies to help people work together. It is relevant to design because collaboration plays an increasingly significant role in design projects that require expertise in a wide range of domains."
(me: contradictory point to the earlier point)

"In extended and distributed design projects, specialists from many different domains must coordinate their efforts despite large separations of time and distance."

"Design can be described as a reflective conversation between designers and the designs they create."
 
"To increase the ``back-talk of the situation,'' we have developed critiquing systems [Fischer et al., 1998] that monitor the actions of users as they work and inform the users of potential problems. "

Diversity

communities of practice - similar people
communities of interest - different people, same area

"Boundary objects [Bowker & Star, 2000; Wenger, 1998] are externalizations of ideas that are used to communicate and facilitate shared understandings across spatial, temporal, conceptual, or technological gaps. In design communities, boundary objects help to establish a shared context for communication by providing referential anchoring [Clark & Brennan, 1991]. Boundary objects can be pointed to and named, helping stakeholders to incrementally increase their shared understanding. "

"Interactive art [Giaccardi, 2004] is based on the premise that computational media enable people to operate at the source of the creative process by creating a ``pool of pixema,'' meaning individual pieces produced by different artists, that can be exchanged to synthesize new paintings. This allows creativity to be shared and no longer limits it to individual artists. The expansion of the creative process claimed by interactive art involves different forms of transcendence: from access to informed participation, from autonomous minds to distributed cognition, and from individual creativity to social creativity. "
(Contradicts earlier statement -- individual creativity is insignificant).

"One of the major objectives of social creativity is to create, accumulate, and share knowledge, and enable innovation. "

As briefly discussed before, domain-oriented design environments empower owners of problems to interact with digital artifacts at a problem domain level.

"Our work has only scratched the surface of exploiting the power of collective minds equipped with new media. The challenges of the complex problems that we all face make this approach not a luxury, but a necessity. "

@incollection{freeman00,
	abstract = {Music is regarded in biological terms as originating in
             the brain, so that most explanations concentrate on the
             ways in which brains process information. Recent studies
             of the nonlinear dynamics of the primary sensory cortices
             have shown that the patterns that are constructed by
             chaotic nonlinear dynamics in cortical neuropil replace
             stimulus driven activity. This finding supports the
             concept that knowledge in brains is entirely constructed
             within them without direct transfer of information from
             outside. As knowledge increases by learning, brains of
             individuals grow progressively apart. The separation
             results from the uniqueness of the knowledge that is
             constructed within each brain. The resulting condition of
             isolation is known among philosophers as epistemological
             solipsism. This view is reinforced by the tenets of
             aesthetics, which emphasize the deeply personal
             experiences of individuals, not as active listeners but
             as passive recipients of beauty in music and other
             arts. Neither conventional neuroscience nor aesthetics
             can explain the deep emotional power of music to move
             humans to action. An alternative view is presented, in
             which human brains are seen to have evolved primarily in
             response to environmental pressures to bridge the
             solipsistic gulf between individuals, and to form
             integrated societies. An evolutionary origin is found in
             the neurohumoral mechanisms of parental bonding to
             altricial infants. A case is made that music together
             with dance have co-evolved biologically and culturally to
             serve as a technology of social bonding. Findings of
             anthropologists and psychiatrists are reviewed to show
             how the rhythmic behavioral activities that are induced
             by drum beats and music can lead to altered states of
             consciousness, through which mutual trust among members

Complexism and The Role of Evolutionary Art (incollection)
Philip Galanter
The Art of Artificial Evolution: A Handbook on Evolutionary Art and Music
Springer-Verlag: Heidelberg, Germany
2008

Postmodernism is taken as given by students of art without realising its history. Notions such as...
- Science is not objective discovery, but is constructed
- Language has no fixed meaning
- The author is dead
- There is no truth, just discourse and political power

Postmodernism in crisis now because of self-contradiction, obvious political undertone, and ultimately nihilistic. 

Postmodernism followed by complexism. Problems of uncertainty have shaken Enlightenment thinking to the core but have not brought maths and science to a halt. 

p328: ``The problem is that 20th Century science and mathematics have yet to be put in an appropriate cultural context. The accurate assimilation of these powerful ideas into the general culture will provide complexist artists with subject matter for many years to come.''

	annote = {The most widely used algorithms for detecting communities tend to take an ag- 
glomerative or divisive approach: building up (or breaking down) a network to 
identify groups or communities [8]. A potential problem with these algorithms 
is that they generate a strictly hierarchical relationship between groups and 
subgroups, which may not be an accurate reflection of reality. 

An alternative approach is to allow overlapping communities. One proposed 
algorithm uses connected cliques as the basis of defining communities, but allows 
individual nodes to belong to more than one community [26].

Community structure: The existence of structure both between and within 
communities is a topic that has only recently attracted attention. There are some 
cases, such as the relationship between functional modules in protein interaction 
networks, in which higher order structures between communities have been ob- 
served [26, 31]. Conversely, researchers are also beginning to recognise that com- 
munities can have an internal, non-homogeneous structure of their own [32, 23]. 
Such structure is thought to have implications for the ability of animal groups to 
make collective decisions, either via consensus, or through the actions of leader 
individuals [33, 34]. 

(competition surely contributes to cohesion then).

Consider two major factors in understanding communities: milieu and function
 The milieu is the physical, social or information environment in which a class of 
functional transactions occur. Functional interactions may be transactions of a 
physical, economic, social or communicative nature. Rather than conflating these 
two types of interaction into a single network layer, as is commonly the case, we 
argue that they should be explicitly separated.},

Chapter 1: Strathernograms, or, the semiotics of mixed metaphors.

p32: Strathern is idealism in Gender of the Gift: idealist standpoint is that which ``describes a world in which teh real is an idea, or a system of ideas, signs and so on, rather than a collection of objects about which we, or the Melanesians, have ideas, or of which our ideas can be taken as representations.''

``The perceptible world is the vehicle of meanings. Meanings, however, do not originate in the perceptible world, which is culturally produced and reproduced. Thus material things and bodies are not isolable things-in-themselves, but exist only in so far as they convey, or encipher, meaning deriving from the code. Because of this they have, in themselves, no fixed identities or (p33) essences as real entities, but can assume limitless identities according to their shifting articulation to the code.''

p33, secondly.... ``Idealists hold that all relations are `internal', that is, participate in a system/code; and that there are no `external' relations, that is, relations between objects which are theoretically independent of one another. In realist ontology, the world consists of a collection of things which exist independently of one another and which enter into external (e.g.) causal relations. These objects can have internal relations, in the sense that the front cover of a book is internally related to the back cover of the same book, but the relation between one book and another book is treated as an external relation. In idealist philosophy (notably Bradley's) it is argued that it is mistaken to assume that one can divide relations into external and internal in this way, and that all relations between objects, or between objects and subjects are internal (like our front and back covers of a book), and in particular, the relation between the perceiver and the thing perceived is an internal relation, whereas for realism it is an external relation.''

p34: Melanesia is not a place but the location of a thought experiment. Postmodernist relativist position: think of it like Abbot's Flatland. Strathern says (pers comm to Gell) ``neither realists nor idealists can obtain visas for Flatland, yet both may take profitable if imaginary trips there.''

The M theory:

An internal relation replaces the work done by the concept of the thing/person as understood by realists. The ultimate constituents are relations, not things/persons. 

p35: ``The perceptible entities which would be thought of as self-sufficient `things' or `people' in anti-M are in M only indices or cyphers of relations, which are regarded as ontologically basic, whereas their sign-vehicles have, so to speak only a secondary status.''

``The idea we have to grasp is that relationships in hte social world are not between visible entities, such as mothers and children, but between terms iwthin the code... Terms are in other words, ideal entities, not perceptible appearances of objects in the physical world.''

p36: two major constraints: all relations are exchange relations, and all relations are gendered.

             compositions using the knowledge extracted from a set of
             example musical fragments provided by the user. The aim
             has been to produce a piece of coherent music that
             resembles that typically found in traditional hymns. A
             set of neural networks are used to capture the conceptual
             ideas that build 'good' music and this knowledge is then
             used to direct a search for the ultimate
             composition. Genetic algorithms hold many member states
             representing partial musical fragments. The neural
             networks cooperate to produce a heuristic value that
             represents the worth of each of these musical
             fragments. This value is then used to evolve better
             compositions based on fragments with high fitness

	annote = {Design happens at design time, but what about what a system might do after that -- learn and evolve? ==> Meta-design.

abstract; ``This approach extends the traditional notion of design beyond the original development of a system to include coadaptive processes between users and systems that enable the users to act as designers in personally meaningful activities and be creative.''

p19; ``It is our belief that improvisation and evolution are more than a luxury: in a world that is not predictable (Suchman 1987), they are a necessity. The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent, but rather of making it an opportunity for more creative and more sustainable solutions. ''

p20: ``The challenge is to create social and technical infrastructures that enable users to cope with the emergent aspects of reality and allow them, when needed and desired, to ``act as designers and be creative'' (Fischer & Giaccardi 2006).''

Meta-design addresses critical design challenges:
Coping with ill-defined problems.
Supporting reflective practitioners.
Design as a collaborative process.  

Distinguish 'design time' and 'use time'.

Compare user-centred (Norman and Draper 1986) with participatory (Schuler and Namioka 1993) design.

Meta-design transcends them.

p21: ``For example, metadesign creates open systems that can be modified by their users and evolve at use time, supporting more complex interactions.''

``Environments supporting creativity and evolution need to be open systems.''
features of open systems:
* must evolve, cannot be designed completely prior to use
* must be designed for evolution ``Designing a system for evolution from the ground up 
can provide a context in which change is expected and can take place.''
* must evolve at the hands of the users
* evolution must take place in a distributed manner

p22: ``in order to support open-ended and creative evolution it is fundamental for individuals to be part of the environment experienced by other individuals''

open systems: (a) promote transcendence of individual mind, (b) support sustained participation, (c) enable the mutual adaption of users and systems.


In a world in which solutions are neither given nor confined in one single mind (Bennis & Biederman 1997), we need to expand the creative process beyond the individual mind 
(haha it's so funny how many times that self-contradiction has turned up)

New concepts: externaliations, mediators and seeds.
Externalisations - things to focus distributed mind on
Mediators - affect participants emotional tone
Seeds - ?

p26 ``While using a system, users will discover mismatches between their needs and the support that an existing system can provide for them, in terms of both failures and opportunities.''
(again I find this language odd, perhaps loaded - why `needs'?)

p26: ``Computational critiquing mechanisms, or critics (Fischer et al. 1998), are generally embedded into the software system. They instantiate and transcend Scho¨ n's theory of design (Scho¨ n 1983); they support reflection-in-action and increase the back-talk of the design situation.''

Either the Earth's self-regulating mechanisms will make the planet less habitable for humans or the side effects of their own activities will cut short the current growth in their numbers.
Humanity will never initiate a symbiosis with the Earth. Even so, it will not destroy its planetary host, Lovelock's third possible outcome. The biosphere is older and stronger than they ever will be.

p.14, there is a deeper reason why 'humanity' will never control technology. Technology is not something that humanity can control. It is an event that has befallen the world.
Once a technology enters human life... it changes it in ways we can never fully understand.

p. 19, Today, only science supports the myth of progress.... The political projects of the twentieth century have failed, or achieved much less than they promised. At the same time, progress in science is a daily experience.... Like the Church in the past, [science] has the power to destroy or marginalise independent thinkers.

p. 21, Galileo did not win in his campaign for Copernican astronomy because he conformed to any precept of 'scientific method'.

p. 23. contradctory presentation of science.

p. 26. Modern humanism is the faith that through science humankind can know the truth - and so be free. But if Darwin's theory of natural selection is true this is impossible. The human mind serves evolutionary success, not truth.

Only someone miraculously innocent of history could believe that competition among ideas could result in the triumph of truth.

p. 27. Darwinian theory tells us that an interest in truth is not needed for survival or reproduction. More often it is a disadvantage. Deception is common among primates and birds.... Among humans the best deceivers are those who deceive themselves. 

Assumes that meme theory assumes that false memes will loose out to true memes.

p. 28, science cannot be used to reshape humankind in a more rational mould.

The upshot of scientific enquiry is that humans cannot be other than irrational.

p. 29, humans cannot live without illusion.

p. 31, Darwin's theory shows the truth of naturalism: we are animals like any other; our fate and that of the rest of life on Earth are the same.

p. 32, the Earth is a self-regulating system whose behaviour resembles in some way that of an organism.

p. 58, important.
"If humanists are to be believed, the Earth -- with its vast wealth of ecosystems and life forms -- had no value until humans came onto the scene. Value is only a shadow cast by humans desiring or choosing. Only persons have any kind of intrinsic worth. Among Christians the cult of personhood may be forgiven. For them, everything of value in the world emenates from a divine person, in whose image humans are made. But once we have relinquished Christianity the very idea of the person becomes suspect."
"A person is someone who believes that she authors her own life through her choices. That is not the way most humans have ever lived. Nor is it how many of those with the best lives had seen themselves.  Did the protagonists of the Odyssey or the Bagavad-Gita think of themselves as persons? Did the characters in The Cantebury Tales? Are we to believe that bushido warriors in Edo Japan, princes and minstrels in medieval Europe, Renaissance courtesans and Mongol nomads were lacking because their lives failed to square with a modern ideal of personal autonomy?"

p. 59, Knowledge does not need minds, or even nervous systems. It is found in all living things.

p. 61, The most creative acts in the life of the mind pass unawares. 

Where other animals differ from humans is in lacking the sensation of selfhood. In this they are not altogether unfortunate. Self-awareness is as much a disability as a power. The most accomplished pianist is not the one who is most aware of her movements when she plays.

p. 64, The life of the mind is like that of the body. If it depended on conscious awareness or control it would fail entirely. 

p. 67, The upshot of neuroscientific research is that we cannot be the authors of our own acts. ... we see our thoughts sometimes as events that happen to us and sometimes as our own acts.... free will is a trick of perspective.

p. 77, [Ravens] show the ability to deceive that comes with the power of language.


--- long section that I mostly really like

p. 125, Science can advance human knowledge, it cannot make humanity cherish truth. Like the Christians of former times, scientists are caught up in the web of power; they struggle for survival and success; their view of the world is a patchwork of conventional beliefs. Science cannot bring 'miracle, mystery and authority' to humankind, if only because -- like those who served the Church in the past -- its servants are all too human.

p. 126, To deny the existence of God is to accept the categories of monotheism. ... atheists say they want a secular world, but a world defined by the absence of the Christians' god is still a Christian world.

p. 147, Like virtual reality technology, shamanistic techniques disrupt the consensual hallucination of everyday life. But with this crucial difference: the shamans know that neither the ordinary world nor the alternate worlds they explore in trance are of their own making. 

p. 149, Lem envisaged his phantomat as a generator of perfect illusions, but any actual machine will be prone to accident and decay. Sooner or later, errors will creep into the program its designers have written for it, and the virtual worlds it conjures up will come to resemble the actual world it was meant to transcend. At that point, we will find ourselves once again in a world we have not made. 

p. 151, Homo rapiens is only one of very many species, and not obviously worth preserving. Later or sooner, it will become extinct. When it is gone the Earth will recover. Long after the last traces of the human animal have disappeared, many of the species it is bent on destroying will still be around, along with others that have yet to spring up. The Earth will forget mankind. The play of life will go on.

p. 155, Science enables humans to satisfy their needs. It does nothing to change them.... There is progress in knowledge, but not in ethics.

p. 160, we are approaching a time when, in Moravec's words, 'almost all humans work to amuse other humans'. .... The function of this new economy, legal and illegal, is to entertain and distract a population which -- though it is busier than ever before -- secretly suspects that it is useless.

Baluja et al (baluja94) first to attempt to fully automate evol art system. Sims' style system, first they logged images from users' interactions. Used neural net to train to users' prefs. Then used neural net as evaluator. Failure.

Other failure all based on problem of evaluation.

Hillis (), following Ray, made a general purpose framework for coevolution. Coevolving sorting networks and difficult test-case strings (to sort by the networks).

Test cases of co-evolutionary art:

Rooke (see Bentley and Corne 2002) coevolution of critics and artworks. Concluded that agents learnt his aesthetic prefs but were unable to take evolution further and explore new space.

Greenfield, inspired by Belpaeme (1999 -- Evolving visual feature detectors) fact that evolved feature detector expressions turned out very small, possibly because they threw away less information. Co-evolving convolution filters (as parasites) and images. The convolution filter aims to predict pixels, the image aims to hinder the success of the prediction.

Humans exemplify a great leap (non-continuous), with 4 mental capacities:

Generative computation (recursive and combinatorial)
Mental symbols
Promiscuous interfaces (ability to integrate information from different realms)
Abstract thought (concepts such as infinity)

Use computer simulations "to determine which of a range of possible cultural variants are evolvable, intelligible, acceptable, learnable and stable over time". ...

"The core idea is that cultural learners can avoid being manipulated by their potential models (those they are inclined to learn from) if they are biased toward models whose actions/displays would seem costly to the model if he held beliefs different from those he expresses verbally. I call these actions inferentially potent displays. "

"The formal analytical model shows that this learning bias creates evolutionarily stable sets of interlocking beliefs and individually-costly practices. "

"cultural evolution, driven by competition among groups or institutions stabilized at alternative sets of these interlocking belief-practice combinations, has led to the association of costly acts, often in the form of rituals, with deeper commitments to group beneficial ideologies, higher levels of cooperation within groups, and greater success in competition with other groups or institutions. "

three predictions from the model: 
(1) participation in costly rituals is associated with prosocial in-group behavior, because costly rituals transmit commitment to group-beneficial beliefs/goals to participants, 
(2) institutions requiring costly displays are favored by cultural evolution because costly displays by members transmit higher levels of belief-commitment and thereby promote cooperation and success in inter-group or inter-institution competition, and 
(3) costly rituals spread via social learning from less successful groups to more successful groups because costly rituals affect groups' success by increasing members' commitment to the group and galvanizing greater cooperation.  

p4: Prestige-biased transmission: "Theory suggests, and a wide range of empirical findings have confirmed, that both children and adults preferentially pay attention to and learn from prestigious/successful models, especially when they match the learner on ethnicity (marked by dialect, dress, etc.) and sex."

p5: "These biases appear to operate across domains of expertise, as experts or stars in one field or endeavor (e.g., basketball) are granted influences in other arenas (e.g., clothing choice or politics)."

Conformist transmission: blending from multiple models.

Content bias: "Specifically, cultural learners should be more likely to pay attention to and store representations when these are judged, ceteris paribus, more (1) potentially actionable, (2) emotionally evocative and (3) plausible or compatible: "


p9/10: "The evolution of high fidelity cultural learning, with all its adaptive benefits (Boyd and Richerson, 1995), increases the potential for exploitation by other members of one's group because cultural learners are open to modifying their behavior (and underlying mental representations) in response to others' behavior. Potential models can manipulate learners by displaying behaviors inconsistent with their true underlying mental representations."

	annote = {Learning can occur in fixed weight continous networks for discrete tasks.
These produce FSM-like dynamics.

Can learning work in continuous tasks? Can it produce FSM-like dynamics.

First, it is now well accepted that neuronal activity itself modifies not only synaptic efficacy but also the intrinsic membrane properties of neurons.
Second, studies have uncovered bewildering diversity in the timescales of activation and inactivation of neurons.

As a result, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying learning is changing towards a dynamical process occurring over multiple timescales. 

 The concept of plasticity is basically no more or less than change on different timescales. Whereas in conventional feedforward neural networks it is traditionally fast changes of node-activations, and slow changes of synaptic-plasticity, there is no need for the differential timescales to be split up in that particular way. 



----

In the continuous trial:

The circuit manages to learn and generalize over the full range of signals on the continuum that it was evolved for. Interestingly, it can remember paired temperatures for longer than it was evolved for, as long as it continues to experience that temperature during tests. The circuit can also remain plastic enough to re-learn new associations within its lifetime. Furthermore, we observed no degradation in the circuit's plasticity over time. 


No finite state machine can represent such internal mechanisms. A richer structure is needed: a machine that includes for each of the discrete states an inner (relatively independent) continuous state. We are calling this set of machines, continuous state machines (CSM). One way to think of these is as a continuous manifold of finite state machines.},

@article{jan00,
	abstract = {The memetic paradigm is herein applied to music.
             While memetics has been used to elucidate a wide
             variety of cultural phenomena, its concerns to date
             have largely been with memes in the realm of
             verbally-expressible concepts. In view of this, this
             paper represents an attempt to integrate the central
             concerns of analytical musicology with a
             neo-Darwinian meme-selectionist perspective. Such a
             viewpoint may be used, it is argued, to unify, under
             a systematic new paradigm, understanding of both
             local issues of musical structure and organization,
             and global issues of musical style configuration and
             its diachronic change. Against the grain of several
             suggestions in the memetics literature, a minimalist
             view of the musical meme is taken, seeing it as
             consisting, at the lower extreme, of configurations
             of as few as three or four notes. The hierarchic
             location of musical memes is a central concern here,
             both in cultural hierarchies - i.e., the replication
             of patterning at different strata within a culture -
             and in structural hierarchies - i.e., the
             replication of patterning at different strata within
             a work, including the level of the global structural
             archetype. Leonard Meyer's perspective on culture is
             employed to frame consideration of the first
             phenomenon, whilst the analytical method of Heinrich
             Schenker is employed to comprehend the second. In
             order to understand how musical memes partake of
             meaning in association with verbally-mediated
             concept memes, the semiology of Ferdinand de
             Saussure and Jean-Jacques Nattiez is employed. The
             article concludes with observations on the
             transmission and mutation of musical memes, and an
             account of how this process engenders the evolution
             of musical styles.},

	abstract = { In this paper we present the GP-Music System, an
             interactive system which allows users to evolve short
             musical sequences using interactive genetic programming,
             and its extensions aimed at making the system fully
             automated. The basic GP-system works by using a genetic
             programming algorithm, a small set of functions for
             creating musical sequences, and a user interface which
             allows the user to rate individual sequences. With this
             user interactive technique it was possible to generate
             pleasant tunes over runs of 20 individuals over 10
             generations. As the user is the bottleneck in interactive
             systems, the system takes rating data from a users run
             and uses it to train a neural network based automatic
             rater, or "auto rater", which can replace the user in
             bigger runs. Using this auto rater we were able to make
             runs of up to 50 generations with 500 individuals per
             generation. The best of run pieces generated by the auto
             raters were pleasant but were not, in general, as nice as
             those generated in user interactive runs. },

             (identification of different musical sequences as
             variations) and its implications for mental
             representations of music. According to reductionist
             theories, listeners judge the structural importance of
             musical events while forming mental
             representations. These judgments may result from the
             production of reduced memory representations that retain
             only the musical gist. In a study of improvised music
             performance, pianists produced variations on
             melodies. Analyses of the musical events retained across
             variations provided support for the reductionist account
             of structural importance. A neural network trained to
             produce reduced memory representations for the same
             melodies represented structurally important events more
             efficiently than others. Agreement among the musicians'
             improvisations, the network model, and music-theoretic
             predictions suggest that perceived constancy across
             musical variation is a natural result of a reductionist
             mechanism for producing memory representations.},

"This metonymic dialectic between ``composed'' and ``improvised'' ways of producing musical texts serves to obscure a more fundamental constructed binary comprising the two most influential musical cultures of the twentieth century, the trans-European and trans African."

p49: A communication cannot occur as an isolated phenomenon, as a singular event brought about by a combination of physical, chemical, living, and psychic causes. Nor can it proceed through simple replication, merely by substituting disappearing elements for one another. It is not enough--and it wouldn't work, anyway--to repeat what has been said (shown, perceived, or thought) once it (p50) dies away. Something else, something new must follow, for the informational component of communication presupposes surprise and gets lost in repetition. Consequently, as we should note in view of what follows, art--once it is differentiated as an autopoietic system--must always present something new, something artistically new; otherwise its communication breaks down or turns into general social communication about artistic quality, prices, the private life of artists, their successes and failures. Operative closure, in other words, requires information in order to move from operation to operation. This is why artworks must convey information not only in themselves, but also in relation to other works--by their novelty or by virtue of the fact that the viewer's observations are not determined unambiguously and can vary with each observation. It is the ultimate reward for the complexity of formal arrangements that they provide an opportunity to discover something new, something that strikes us as more astonishing every time we look at them. Conversely, a work that lacks complexity is complete to offer more conspicuous or, to put it bluntly, more scandalous forms of novelty. Another feature of autopoietic systems is that they are limited to one type of operation, which they must employ for the dual purpose of producing further operations and of creating structures that  serve as programs for this production and allow the system to distinguish between systems-immanent / system-external events. An autopoietic system reproduces both its reproduction and the condition for its reproduction. 

p50/51 Taken by itself, the concept of autopoiesis explains very little... One cannot derive the existence of worms, birds and human beings from the singular invention of the autopoiesis of life. The autopoiesis of communication does not tell what kinds of social formations will emerge in the course of evolution. Nor can ne infer from the autopoiesis of art which works will be created. The concept's lack of explanatory power stands in disproportional relationship to its revolutionizing effect. (This insight could have avoided much controversy). 

p51 We can certainly consider the structural consequences of a society without art. The regeneration of art is autopoietically necessary only for art itself. This is a matter of general agreement, even in aesthetic theories of quite different orientation. Of course, artistic communication could never come about without society, without consciousness, without life or material. But in order to determine how the autopoiesis of art is possible, one must observe the art system and treat everything else as environment. 

p51 When using compact concepts such as 'observer', 'beholder', 'artist', 'artwork' and so forth, we are always referring to \emph{condensations of the communication system of art}... Artists, artworks, and so on serve a structuring function within the autopoiesis of art. They bundle expectations. This is why they are less ephemeral than the basal events of artistic communication. They make sure that communications--which operate as events--can reach back and forth while remaining focused on the same thing--on the same work, the same artist, or on the educational qualities of an informed observer. 

p52. Artistic communication distinguishes itself both from communication that relies exclusive on language and from indirect communications that are either analogous to language or unable to secure the autopoeisis of communication, because the communicative intent of conveying information can always be denied. Artistic communication, by contrast, employs perceptions that it prepares exclusively for its own use. In so doing, artistic communication realizes specific forms of structural coupling between consciousness and society. It communicates by means of distinctions located within the work or by means of forms, for the concept of form, in the sense we use it here, implies a two-sided form, a distinction that can be distinguished. The work of art, then, is anything but an `end-in-itself'. Nor does it serve external purposes--for example, as ornament. It determines forms which yield the dual insight that (1) distinctions make possible indications that enter into a play of nonarbitrary combination with other distinctions and indications, and that (2) along with this recognition, it becomes apparent that this order contains information that is meant to be communication and understood.},

	abstract = {Consider a potter throwing a vessel on the wheel. Think of the complex ways brain, body, wheel and clay relate and interact with one another throughout the different stages of this activity and try to imagine some of the resources (physical, mental or biological) needed for the enaction of this creative process. Focus, for instance, on the first minutes of action when the potter attempts to centre the lump of clay on the wheel. The hands are grasping the clay. The fingers, bent slightly following the surface curvature, sense the clay and exchange vital tactile information necessary for a number of crucial decisions that are about to follow in the next few seconds. What is it that guides
the dextrous positioning of the potter?s hands and decides upon the precise amount of forward or downward pressure necessary for centring a lump of clay on the wheel? How do the potter?s fingers come to know the precise force of the
appropriate grip? What makes these questions even more fascinating is the ease by which the phenomena which they describe are accomplished. Yet underlying the effortless manner in which the potter?s hand reaches for and gradually
shapes the wet clay lies a whole set of conceptual challenges to some of our most deeply entrenched assumptions about what it means to be a human agent.},
	annote = {...to look for some `internal' mental and inaccessible mechanism.

p20/21: "The potter's fingers simply receive information from the clay and transmit it to the appropriate area inside the potter's brain; they have nothing to do with the central `executive' mechanism responsible for the `executive processing' and decision making."

p21: "`agency question', ie, who did it? Who is the author of the act? The paradox is that although the potter may again be totally unaware about how or when his brain is making all these fine small decisions or even about what precisely they consist of, this time, he is, more often than not, going to answer that question, with the ease of a natural-born dualist: `I' did it."

 trees-eyes-brain-muscles-axe-stroke-tree; and it is this total system that has the characteristics of immanent mind. . .But this is not how the average Occidental sees the event sequence of tree felling. (Bateson 1973, 318).

Two categorical errors explain the mistake: apparent mental causation and agency attribution.

 According to Wegner, both errors pertain to the fact that people tend to experience conscious will, and thus agency, quite independently of any actual causal connection between their thoughts and actions (Wegner 2004, 654)

"Imagine for a moment that by some magical process, you could always know when a particular tree branch would move in the wind. Just before it moved, you knew it was going to move, in which direction, and just how it would do it. " (Wegner 2004, 654). 

p22: agency problem result "of a certain acquired imbalance between mental and physical causality that destabilises the human cognitive equation. "

"To redress this imbalance at the root of the agency problem in this chapter I shall be introducing the notion of material agency. The concept itself, that is, material agency, is to some extent a misnomer, yet I believe it serves well my basic hypothesis which can be very simply expressed as follows: If human agency is then material agency is, there is no way that human and material agency can be disentangled. Or else, while agency and intentionality may not be properties of things, they are not properties of humans either: they are the properties of material 
engagement, that is, of the grey zone where brain, body and culture conflate. "

I consider clay to be one of the earliest truly neurocompatible materials in the history of humanity.

p23: sense of agency versus sense of ownership. Needn't be the same. Also, only a 'sense'.

"It is one thing to say that only humans have a sense of agency, that is, the ability to refer to oneself as the author of one's own actions; it is another thing to say that only humans are agents in the sense of being able to initiate casual events with intentional character."

Important to underline that the interaction is between equal partners, but this does NOT mean that there are not differences between the partners -- i.e., the environment does not simply trigger our actions, nor does everything come from within.

p25: "lthough few of us can resist the allure of a good phenomeno logical description that pull us inside this seamless flow of activity and agency, when we cut the flow and press the question of agency our inner Cartesian self wakes up to take control of the situation."

But is it not still the potter who takes the accountability, makes the decision?

"Is there any way out of this? One way to proceed, I suggest, is to try and cut deep across the scales of time. In other words, try to develop a detailed temporal anatomy of the act. What is really important in this context is that our account of the causal hierarchy of events will not trivialise the complexities of the processes engaged in decision-making. To accomplish that, the starting point cannot be agency --the natural property of the human actor -- the starting point should be time."

Liebet's experiments: (1) a specific electrical change in the brain (the RP) that begins 550 ms before the act, stage (2) human subjects became aware of the intention to act 350--400 msec after RP starts and finally, stage (3) human 
subjects became aware of the intention 200 msec before the motor act. 

 This means that conscious will cannot be the true agent. 


The orthodox view, as Gell describes it, defines the agent according to the ``capacity to initiate causal events in his/her vicinity, which cannot be ascribed to the current state of the physical cosmos, but only to a special category of mental states; that is, intentions'' (Gell 1998, 19). 

My suggestion is the following: Accepting that agency is about causal events in the physical world rather than about representational events in our mental world, it follows that if an association between agency and intentionality can be 
made, it has to be with the type of intentionality here called ``intention-in-action''. In the case of ``prior intention'', no such correlation can be made before this intention becomes realised in the world -- that is, before it meets its relevant 
condition of satisfaction. This I argue is because as long as ``prior intention'' is simply an internal representational state, it has no pragmatic effect in the world.

Note that prior intention is not necessarily the cause of intention in action.

Searle - background -- set of know-how that agent takes to intention in action.

But... p32/33 "Seen from this angle, the `Background' becomes a part of the mind or what we may call an extended intentional state. This implies that the objects and material structures that constitute this `Background' can be argued to project towards me as much as I project towards them."

p33: argument for material agency: "The argument is that agency is not a property but the emergent product of the 
`irreducible tension of mediated activity'"

p34: "The shaping of the pot becomes an act of collaboration between the potter and the mass of wet clay rapidly spinning upon the wheel."

"Agency as an emergent property cannot be reduced to any of the human -- nonhuman components of 
action. It can only be characterised according to that component that at a given moment has the upper hand in the ongoing phenomenological struggle. "

	annote = {3 organisational features of culture and 3 fundamental operating principles of the mind:

1. systematicity <---> cognitive principle of relevance
2. recurrence of distinctions across semantic, conceptual and practical boundaries <--> decompositionality of cognitive processing
3. bleeding of properties between associated concepts <--> network structure of semantic memory

Take Sperber's definition of culture as the stuff that is recurrent / regular in a population without assuming it can't vary still, and without presupposing any specific reason for the recurrence -- only that it is not strictly random.


1. 

Many anthropologists, e.g., Geertz, attribute culture with a systematicity. Touchy subject since systamaticity may be due to domination. But although systematic, cultures are not integrated wholes. p55 "cultural signifiers are frequently indeterminate and negotiated, subject to the often-conflicting interests of their recruiters," 

Rather culture is a series of internally coherent systems (shared amongst people - although my differ from one individual to the next -- an individual is a mix of cultures).

explain systematicity with Sperber and Wilson's (1995) Relevance theory.

p56: "Applied to individual thought the cognitive principle of relevance states that, ceteris paribus, people will attend more to inferences with relatively greater cognitive eff ects than to those with relatively smaller cognitive eff ects, with the entailment that the greater an inference's connectivity to other ideas and the stronger those connections, the more cognitive resources will be allocated to its processing. Individual human thought will, therefore, tend to favor representations that are systematized more than those that are less so. "

or...

"people will attend more to those messages that connect to their existing ideas, that have ramifications for their mental models of the world, than to those that do not." 

So this explains systematicity -- can think in terms of what ideas 'resonate' throughout populations.


2.

consistent ways of thinking...

dualistic thinking
basically - recurrent use of distinctions across domains

explained by cognitive process: decomposition

conceptual bleeding - semantic memory is efficient, revealing something about its organisation in the brain --> semantic networks. These explain the bleeding.},

Whitelaw - metacreation: shift from producing artefacts to producing things that produce artefacts .
p.418: Machines of the future ``may develop their own lines of creative enquiry, producing results that are not derivative of some existing human style or genre, but exhibit a high degree of independent artistic creativity.''

More enlightening: ``human-computer synergistics.''

Open problem 1: To devise more formalised and objective definitions of art, artistic creativity and novelty. 
Defn of art: many things implicated. Mention of Dissanayake. Making special, teaching the value of community achievements.

Defn of novelty: combinatorics (Dartnall 2002). 

Classification of EMA research: 
- use technique X from complexity research
- use aesthetic selection to evolve X
- devise a fitness function

Goals of EMA: 
- generate art for humans
- research that explores concepts

Use statistical models and feature detectors to learn complex space of artworks. Tell us what is good and bad and authentic.

Interactive aesthetic selection has a number of problems:
- People take time
- People can only make comparisons in small sets
-> Population size has to be small
- non-uniform genotype-phenotype mapping
- size of genotypes is limited.

Ref to McCormack: Evolving the Audience (description of Eden). Alternatives to direct aesthetic selection. Applicable in some areas but not all. 

Open problem 2: make fitness functions that measure human aesthetic properties. Must be computable.

Ramachandran: 'ten laws of art that cut across cultural boundaries'. (2003: The Emerging Mind, Reith Lectures): peak shifting, grouping, contrast, isolation, perceptual problem solving, symmetry, abhorrence of coincidence or generic viewpoints, repetition, rhythm, orderliness, balance and metaphor.

A problem with using aesthetic measures is the problem of lack of interpretation and additional context.

Open problem 3: To devise a system where genotype, phenotype and mechanism between are capable of automated and robust modification, selection and hence evolution.

Viewing artist and process as all embodied and situated.

Open problem 4: To define creative universes that can be implemented in computer simulation.

list of criticisms of EMA: naive, fetishistic, Western, lacking broadness of view. 
p. 443: ``If EMA is to mature, it needs to become recognised as art for what it is, in addition to how it was made.''

Open problem 5: To create EMA systems that contribute to art.

-> new version of Turing test, where artistic outcomes are compared alongside human ones.

--> leads to the problem of how to make good instruments. ``In a cybernetic sense, musician and instrument are one, with brain, body and instrument intimately linked as a performance system.'' See theories of `extended mind', rooted in Cybernetics research and championed by Andy Clark (2003) and Mike Wheeler (2005). 

Argues that software is lacking when compared to physical tools/instruments such as pencils and pianos.
Levin: instantly knowable, and indefinitely masterable.
One needs to feel an intimacy with the system.
Tighter coupling between aesthetics and process.
The challenge (op 6) is to create a software instrument that equals or exceeds traditional instruments in terms of creative possibility. 
``It would be easy to argue that this is already the case for some computer tools; however, a closer analysis shows it is really only part of the broader automation of society and culture that the computer has enabled over the last fifty years.''

	annote = {Babytalk includes poetic elements: metrics, phonetics and foregrounding. Helps to shape baby's attention.

"We hypothesize that the ability to respond to poetic features of language is present as early as the first few weeks of life and that this ability attunes cognitive and affective capacities in ways that provide a foundation for the skills at work in later aesthetic production and response."

Link between developmental social process and formal cognitive aspects of art.


339: "When normal ongoing positive interaction via dual video is experimentally desynchronized (i.e., the baby is presented with a slightly delayed replay of a recorded sequence of just-experienced positive interaction with the mother), 6- to 12-week infants show signs of psychological distress such as averted gaze, closed mouth, frown, grimace, fingering of clothing, and the displacement activity of yawning"

340: "For their part, the precocious ability of infants to elicit and respond to contingently interactive visual, vocal, and kinesic signals of caretakers suggests an evolved and primary human capacity and need for mutuality, expressed in a temporally coordinated social-emotional relationship preceding and going beyond the needs for protection, reassurance, or care implied by classical attachment (Bowlby 1969), parental investment (Trivers 1972, 1974), or parental solicitude theory (Daly and Wilson 1995)"

352: "Outside a directly evolutionist framework, other investigators have noted that participation in early interactions aids an infant's homeostatic equilibrium (Hofer 1987), biobehavioral self-regulation (Beebe and Lachmann 1994; Spangler et al. 1994), and self-organization (Tronick 1998). Such participation also develops an infant's cognitive "narrative" abilities for recognizing agency, object, goal, and instrumentality (Stem 1985); predisposes the infant generally to intellectual and social competence, including 
recognizing intentionality, engaging in reciprocity, and developing expansion (recall and prediction) beyond the present situation (Hundeide 1991); and reinforces neural structures predisposed for socioemotional functioning (Jaffe et al. 2001; Schore 1994; Trevarthen and Aitken 1995). "

But role of "social contingency" is not well recognised.

354: "We suggest that our identification of affective aesthetic (or protoaesthetic) elements in babytalk provides a biological or naturalistic basis for Formalist claims about the importance of sound structure in poetry."

355: "Our findings further suggest that language is important not only for naming objects or requesting things in the world, or externalizing thoughts, as some evolutionary psychologists and cognitive scientists propose, or for fitting in with socio-historical-political constructs, as some poststructural cultural theorists have claimed, one must not overlook the importance of human language in negotiating shared meanings with other persons, maintaining social relationships, and demonstrating emotional reciprocity"

"One can propose that because of human infant immaturity (altriciality), e primate propensity for relationship--not only or simply "sociability"-- became so crucial that special affinitive mechanisms to enhance (reinforce) mother-infant interaction evolved to ensure it."

"What no other investigators of this interactive behavior have mentioned is that the preverbal competencies and sensitivities utilized in babytalk are in themselves the rudimentary affective and aesthetic elements that human individuals and societies ultimately build upon in an ordered and sophisticated manner when they engage in the arts. "
(how rigorously is this demonstrated -- rather than just that they are kinda communicative).

355/356: "the simplifications, repetitions, exaggerations, and elaborations in visual, kinesic, and vocal modalities; their organization into theme and variations; the use of structural features such as framing, phrasing, pacing, and closure; the development of pretense; the manipulation of anticipation and expectation; the use of phonetic tones and clusters; variations in rhythm--these are the same features and operations that artists use for the similar purpose of attracting attention and provoking and shaping emotional response."
(objection - these are so abstract).

357: "Had our ancestors wished to devise a way to promote group cohesion and a sense of common purpose, and to relieve individual anxiety, they could hardly have done better than to co-opt the mechanisms for mutuality that were in place between mothers and 6- to 8-week infants in order to reliably and compellingly shape attention, coordinate emotional state, enculturate, and bond."

	abstract = {In algorithmic music composition, a simple technique
             involves selecting notes sequentially according to a
             transition table that specifies the probability of the
             next note as a function of the previous context. An
             extension of this transition-table approach is described,
             using a recurrent autopredictive connectionist network
             called CONCERT. CONCERT is trained on a set of pieces
             with the aim of extracting stylistic
             regularities. CONCERT can then be used to compose new
             pieces. A central ingredient of CONCERT is the
             incorporation of psychologically grounded representations
             of pitch, duration and harmonic structure. CONCERT was
             tested on sets of examples artificially generated
             according to simple rules and was shown to learn the
             underlying structure, even where other approaches
             failed. In larger experiments, CONCERT was trained on
             sets of J.S. Bach pieces and traditional European folk
             melodies and was then allowed to compose novel
             melodies. The overall results cast doubt on the promise
             of note-by-note prediction for composition.},

physical processes by including them within a single analytical system, an ecosystem" (Geertz 1963:3). 

p82: "It may be objected here that the idea of adaptation is confused by considering both physical and external socio-cultural factors as effective environment. I shall try to demonstrate, however, that it is difficult to conduct an ecological inquiry without reference to social as well as natural surroundings. This is particularly clear in situations of change when a new adjustment results from altered social pressures within the environment"

p83: Helm (1962: 633) suggests the term "oecumene", "comprehending not only space and habitat but the sociocultural resources and groups beyond the society but within its experiential field."},

	abstract = {We outline a framework within which machine
             compositions may be evaluated objectively. In particular,
             the framework allows statements about those compositions
             to be refuted on the basis of empirical
             experimentation. We consider this to be fundamental if we
             wish to evaluate the degree to which our programs achieve
             their compositional aims. Furthermore, a review of the
             literature reveals that this is a largely ignored aspect
             of research into algorithmic composition. Our framework
             involves four components: specifying the compositional
             aims; inducing a critic from a set of example musical
             phrases; composing music that satisfies the critic; and
             evaluating specific claims about the compositions in
             experiments using human subjects. We describe a system
             which exemplifies these four stages and which
             demonstrates the practicality of the framework. Finally,
             the application of the framework to the evaluation of
             musical creativity is discussed and directions for future
             research are suggested.},

p120: "Many words could be spent arguing about whether nature's generativity--the Darwinian evolutionary process--is 'real' creativity. But such debates risk circularity, because they typically identify 'real' creativity with the human model, and who is to say what the right model should be? Trying to decide how authentically creative natural selection is may not tell us the most about creativity."

Creativity is about 'adaptive novelty'
Klondike spaces: gold prospecting analogy. 

4 features of Klondike spaces: 
Rarity -- payoff is sparsely distributed
Isolation -- regions are isolated
Oasis -- (same as Isolation) good regions are hard to leave
Plateau -- no direction is better than any other to search.

Perkins seems to think that natural selection faces some 'problems' of searching spaces. 

p131: Examples of successful inventors. Lots of 'systematized chance' : "The searcher systematically surveys a sizeable number of options that fall within a defined set, seeking ones with the target characteristics"

p136/7: "A system (human beings, natural selection, or whatever) is creative to the extent that it copes with these four challenges. Creativity \emph{is} the ability and tendency to cope with them."

137: 
rarity; does the system have a good hit rate?
isolation; has the system explored widely?
oases; has the system avoided getting hung up on a successful solution?
plateaus; has the system moved quickly beyond marginally satisfactory regions? (huh? this makes false assumptions about what we know about Klondike spaces.)},

@article{pollack94,
	abstract = {Many researchers in AI and cognitive science believe that the com- 
plexity of a behavioral description reflects the underlying informa- 
tion processing complexity of the mechanism producing the 
behavior. This paper explores the foundations of this complexity 
argument. We first distinguish two types of complexity judgements 
that can be applied to these descriptions and then argue that neither 
type can be an intrinsic property of the underlying physical system. 
In short, we demonstrate how changes in the method of observation 
can radically alter both the number of apparent states and the appar- 
ent generative class of a system's behavioral description. From 
these examples we conclude that the act of observation can suggest 
frivolous computational explanations of physical phenomena, up to 
and including cognition.},
	annote = {the consensus of cognitive science has held that the mind/brain is computing something; identifying exactly what it is computing has emerged as the goal of the field. 

For instance, a shift in measurement granularity can promote the apparent complexity of a system from a context-free 
language to a context-sensitive language.

One way of understanding a system is by gauging its complexity. We have some good intuitions about certain relative comparisons: a human being is generally considered more complex than a rock. What does this ordering entail? 

2 measures in the literature: 
1. a measure of complexity based upon the number of unique moving parts within a system (complexion).
2. generative class. Imagine a sequence of mechanisms, specified within a fixed framework, with ever increasing complexion.

Generative class truly addresses complexity: finite state descriptions: all 1s or random 1s and 0s can come from a single state generator, since one is not dependent on its predecessor.

Complexity measures applied to physical systems attempted by Crutchfield and Young 1989},

The computational model consists of multiple novelty-seeking agents that can assess the interestingness of artworks. The agents can communicate to particularly interesting artworks to others. Agents can also communicate to reward other agents for finding interesting artworks. We present the results from running experiments to investigate the effects of searching for different degrees of novelty on the artworks produced and the social organisation of the agents.},

@article{sloboda98,
	abstract = {A received view in music psychology is that to have
             assigned to a piece of music a certain kind of structural
             description (in which elements are marked as more or less
             prominent, or more or less related to one another) is to
             have understood it. Yet this view is open to the
             "Searlean" criticism that it has ignored the essential
             elements of human understanding of music, namely, the
             dynamic feelings of tension and resolution, anticipation,
             growth and decay, which the music engenders when
             experienced as structure. It is argued that these
             feelings are plausible candidates for the basic elements
             of a musical semantics. Such feelings are not emotions as
             commonly understood, although they may engender emotions
             in some circumstances. The characteristics of music which
             engender these feelings are similar (or analogous) to
             characteristics of the experienced physical and
             biological world, particularly of objects in motion (or
             agents in action). Thus, in some circumstances,
             combinations of these elemental feelings can give rise to
             the sense that music has "personality" or
             "atmosphere". Some psychological research investigating
             structural concomitants of dynamic feelings is
             discussed. },

@inproceedings{spectalp94,
	abstract = {Researchers wishing to create computational systems
             that themselves generate artworks face two interacting
             challenges. The first is that the standards by which
             artistic output is judged are notoriously difficult to
             quantify. The larger AI community is currently involved
             in a rich internal dialogue on methodological issues,
             standards, and rigor, and hence murkiness with regard to
             the assessment of output must be faced squarely. The
             second challenge is that any artwork exists within an
             extraordinarily rich cultural and historical context, and
             it is rare that an artist who is ignorant of this context
             will produce acceptable works. In this paper the authors
             assert that these considerations argue for case-based
             AI/Art systems that take critical criteria as
             parameters. They describe an example system that produces
             new bebop jazz melodies from a case-base of melodies,
             using genetic programming techniques and a fitness
             function based on user-provided critical criteria. They
             discuss the role that such techniques may play in future
             work on AI and the arts.},

Murky issue of aesthetic judgement.

It is not clear how these interactions (training, evaluating, etc) can form the basis for a general theory of aesthetic judgement sufficient to ground a science of artist construction.

Another approach to this problem is to work in a genre with codified formalized valuation criteria.
3 problems with this...
1. existing formulations are often of dead forms
2. is adherence to the rules good aesthetic criteria
3. not clear that this will generalise

"The alternative approach that we propose is to factor aesthetic judgement out of the systems that we develop. We don't need to know what the 'right' criteria are for aesthetic judgement: we only need to know that our systems are capable of conforming to the range of criteria that might be proposed."

Develop systems that take critical criteria as parameters.

Develop a large case-base of prior works as examples such that you can 'factor' out culture from the system (as with critic) -- treat it as an input rather than as a 'part of the system'. 

In conclusion: Johnson-Laird (1991) rejects neo-Darwinian theories of creativity. GAs and GP offer the promise of tractable evolutionary processing, and hence theories of creativity-through-evolution may now be explored experimentally. The work in this paper offers a relatively clean way to separate out issues of aesthetic judgement from issues of system judgement... this allows us to consider the ability of our system to please critics within cultures, without involving us in questions of aesthetics. },

	abstract = {Two ma jor goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions to complex problems. In this paper, we argue that complexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals. We demonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures. NEAT is applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head. Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification. When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed struc- 
ture, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies. The results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize. },
	annote = {Complexification facilitates discovery and improvement of solutions.

This process is based on three technical components: (1) Keeping track of which genes match up with which among differently sized genomes throughout evolution; (2) speciating the population so that solutions of differing complexity can exist independently; and (3) starting evolution with a uniform population of small networks.

Now consider 'open-ended problems' (coevolution).

The main results were that (1) evolution did complexify when possible, (2) complexification led to elaboration, and (3) significantly more sophisticated and successful strategies were evolved with complexification than without it.},

This disturbance in local conditions creates a niche that potentially could be filled by another species (which would then create still more niches and so on). The model is unique in allowing the complexity of the organisms---measured by the number of genes they possess in order to be well adapted to their local environment---to evolve over time, and is therefore the first model with which it is possible to study the contribution of niche construction to the evolution of organism complexity. Results of experiments demonstrate that the process of niche construction does indeed introduce an active drive for organisms with more genes. This is the first explicit example of a model which possesses an intrinsic drive for the evolution of complexity.},

@article{tilman00,
	annote = {Both laboratory and field studies have shown that ecosystem processes are more variable (less stable or reliable) at lower diversity (see review by McCann, pages 228--233, and refs 8--10). The greater stability of more diverse ecosystems seems to result from three processes11, 12, 13, 14. The first is comparable to the economic process that causes a more diverse investment portfolio to be less volatile. Because species, like corporations, differ from each other, they tend to respond somewhat independently to environmental variability. The more species that such variability is averaged across, the less variable is their total11. Second, species within a given trophic level often compete with each other, which causes their abundances to negatively covary. When one species declines, another is freed from competition and increases. This negative covariance reduces the variability of the community as a whole13, 14. Finally, measures of temporal stability compute variability relative to mean abundance, such as by using the ratio of community abundance to its temporal standard deviation. The tendency for community abundance to increase as diversity increases thus causes this ratio, which is a measure of stability, to increase as diversity increases14.

[i don't think I get the last point, nor the following...]

The effects on ecosystem functioning of many such mechanisms of coexistence have yet to be determined theoretically. However, it is already clear that the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can greatly influence how diversity affects ecosystem processes19, 20. Consider, for instance, plant species that coexist in a spatially heterogeneous habitat because of differences in both the soil pH and the temperature (which varies seasonally) at which each grows optimally (Fig. 2a). Such niche differentiation20 causes the predicted productivity of plant communities to be an increasing function of plant diversity (Fig. 2b). Moreover, the pattern of this increase is such that there are some species combinations at a given level of diversity that are more productive than any possible combination of fewer species (Fig. 2b). The greater productivity of higher diversity communities occurs because, in such heterogeneous habitats, each species is a superior performer in only a portion of sites. Clearly, the magnitude of this effect increases as heterogeneity or diversity increase. Increased diversity leads, on average, to increased 'coverage' of the habitat conditions, that is, to increased efficiency of resource capture and use, because diversity increases the chance that the species that are better able to handle particular conditions are present. Assuming that species are chosen at random, diversity is a simple way to measure the range and coverage of species traits in a community.},

collective representations are highly variable across cultures and clearly possess a certain autonomy. Nevertheless, within a given culture they provide an indispensable framework for all meaningful actions, including those required for survival.},

             humans) show a surprising amount of variety both across
             time and at any one instant in a population. Traditional
             accounts and simulation models of the evolution of
             communication offer little explanation of this
             diversity. Sexual selection of signals used to attract
             mates, and the coevolving preferences used to judge those
             signals, can instead provide a convincing mechanism. Here
             we demonstrate that a wide variety of ``songs'' can
             evolve when male organisms sing their songs to females
             who judge each male's output and decide whether or not to
             mate with him based on their own coevolved
             aesthetics. Evolved variety and rate of innovation are
             greatest when females combine inherited song preferences
             with a desire to be surprised. If females choose mates
             from a small pool of candidates, diversity and rate of
             change are also increased. Such diversity of
             communication signals may have implications for the
             evolution of brains as well. },

Florian Cramer: dualism between software formalism and software culturalism
Generativity of code versus software as cultural text.

Apparently a persistent split.

``[Software art] can present not only an 'image' of our situation, but more powerfully, a systemic abstraction, a model.''

System Stories: critical approach. 
Traditionally theory rests of the nature of software domain, or question of software as art, but argues that ``any critique must be able to address the specifics of their generative systems; that the systems, not their outputs or residues, are the core off the work. System can be distinguished from code: code is the language-specific text that implements the abstract, formal structure that I will call system. So a code-literate reader can interpret system from code, but systems can also be described in other forms, either 'natural' or other languages.''

Must describe the stories behind systems? System stories are not singular or objective; each one is a particular and situated reading.

``A cultural critique of software are systems is the bridge spanning Cramer's formalist / culturalist  duality.''

More important though; ``If generative software art communicates system stories, particularly in the form of model wolds or ontologies, then it is potentially a platform for telling system stories that are more sophisticated, critical or experimental; it could take seriously the prospect that Manovich proposes, the potential of software and generative technique to provide images of, or or rather {\it imaginations} of, the (social, cultural, personal, material...) systems we live in. Generative art has a unique potential here, because unlike other art forms its basic materials are systems themselves.''

Modern sense emerges in late c18.

p42:
``This complex set of historical distinctions between various kinds of human skill and between various basic purposes in the use of such skills is evidently related both to changes in the practical division of labour and to fundamental changes in the practical definitions of the purposes of the exercise of skill. It can be primarily related to the changes inherent in capitalist commodity production, with its specialisation and reduction of use values to exchange values. The was a consequent defensive specialisation of certain skills and purposes to \emph{the arts} or \emph{the humanities} where forms of general use and intention which were not determined by immediate exchange could at least be conceptually abstracted. This is the formal basis of the distinction between \emph{art} and \emph{industry}, and between \emph{fine arts} and \emph{useful arts} (the latter eventually acquiring a new specialised term in TECHNOLOGY).''

Thus artist is set outside of normal ideas of production, but ironic because most art is commodity and `artist' defines a job.

p82: Creative.

originally used in context of original divine creation. Creature. Augustine: the creature, who has been created, cannot himself create.

16c 
Tasso: 2 creators - god and the poet
Sidney: god made man in his image so man can create.

but Donne: poetry is counterfeit creation (possibly as false, else as imitation)

p83:

18c - conscious assoc w art (``a word which was itself changing in a complimentary direction'')
-> `creative' - faculty of humans without past divine event.

``By eC19 it was consious and powerful; by mC19 conventional. Creativity, a general name for the faculty, followed in C20.''
``But there is one obvious difficulty. The word puts a necessary stress on originality and innovation, and when we (p84) remember the history we can see that these are not trivial claims.''

p84: Difficulty -- once indended for a high claim becomes conventional -- e.g., anything dubbed `creative writing' is creative. 

``Given the large elements of simple IDEOLOGICAL and HEGEMONIC reproduction in most of the written and visual arts, a description of everything of this kind as \emph{creative} can be at once confusing and seriously misleading.''

``Yet such difficulties are inevitable when we realise the necessary magnitude and complexity of the interpretation of human activity which creative now so indespensibly embodies.''
